I was born in Lombok, Indonesia. I studied at Bumigora University majoring in Visual Communication Design (DKV). My main skill is creating mobile application programs and also specific websites using the React library. In addition to coding skills, I do a lot of activities related to graphic design to creating user interfaces for an application or website.

Currently, I work a lot on android-based applications using the React Native library, one of my latest portfolios is a prekuel app, which is an application that displays news related to film information that I wrote myself.

In early March 2022, I worked remotely as a junior frontend developer for 1 month at a company in Jakarta. We developed a website that regulates the management of pensioners for customers of one of the banks in Indonesia. That brief experience gave me many lessons related to work systems in the IT field, especially in the programming field.

I really like programming, and always follow the latest updates about programming. Especially for React libraries. My hope in the future is that I can help more people with programming, either individually with the projects I make, or as a contribution to the team.
